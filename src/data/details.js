    info: 'Many of the most popular amps today are 25+ years old and are well beyond their expected service life. Eventually that sweet vintage tube amp will need to be "overhauled" to produce good tone and stay off the repair bench.   An overhaul is not a repair. The overhaul process is maintenance for amps that are past their life expectancy. Your amp probably doesn\'t need an overhaul unless it is over 20 years old and has not been maintained or is unused for an extended time.   An overhaul returns your old amp to original specs, includes functional analysis of all circuits and replacing the known failure parts that have not been previously replaced.',
